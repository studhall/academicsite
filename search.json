    "text": "This is the first blog post in a series specifically geared toward exploring the ownership of substance use disorder treatment centers (TCs). I was motivated to start this series when reading Sloan’s chapter (21) in the Handbook of Health Economics which can be found here. I have been reading specifically that chapter of the handbook as I finish some work on a project assessing the impact of a supply shock to the treatment system here in Oregon. At first, I viewed this paper as mostly a straight forward supply shock that would result in a change in admissions to treatment, but as I explored the incentives of the TCs a bit more I believe the question not to be as straight forward. While I was viewing TCs through a more altruistic view — that is, assuming funding TCs would lead to increased admissions in particular for those most at risk — I had not yet looked into how the market structure for health care does not necessarily predict the same thing.\nThe purpose of today’s post is simply to walk through the motivation for exploring the ownership decision of healthcare firms, and particularly hospitals. I then compare some descriptive statistics for the U.S. and at the state-level of the ownership breakdown of TCs. The eventual idea is to understand if the same problems facing hospitals due to ownership allocation can be applied to TCs.\nWhat do I even mean by the ownership decision? That is the decision for a hospital to be private non-profit, private for-profit or publicly owned.\nSloan explains the motivation for exploring ownership in the context of healthcare as follows:\n\nUnder the view of a firm as a nexus of contracts, the ownership decision is a cost minimizing problem — particularly with respect to transaction costs.\nHealth care is no exception, except, the contracts are a bit more complex than the typical firm.\n\nThe product purchaser, i.e. the health services consumer (the patient), is often not the full payor (their marginal cost is lower than the true marginal cost).\nThe product purchaser has less information about the products than the suppliers.\nSince the consumer is not the payor, equilibrium determinations are made by comparing the willingness to pay (WTP) of the true payor and the producer, but the payor (e.g. insurance companies) do not reveal their WTP so easily.\n\nDue to the asymmetric information, hospitals will only provide socially optimal care to the extent they receive direct payment.\n\nThis means that patients with a lower reimbursement rate or high transaction cost could receive less care than those with higher reimbursement rates.\nIn other words, the marginal revenue framework of hospitals tells us they are incentivized to treat insured patients.\n\n\nSocial planners know the incentives of hospitals (somewhat) and have created incentives to ensure hospitals provide treatment even to those with low reimbursement rates. One of the most salient examples of this is the provision of charity care by hospitals. Hospitals receive tax breaks for a certain level of charity care provided; property tax at the state level and income tax at the federal level are typical. Note that this doesn’t just apply to hospitals for the most part and extends to any non-profit. For-profit hospitals cannot receive this tax break — a clear example of the sort of ownership-as-a-cost-minimization I was discussing at the beginning.\nIf you are interested in more of this work, here are three papers I had been reading. I highly recommend reading the one by Chen (2016) for background:\n\nHospital Competition and Charity Care, Garmon (2006) here\nTHE PROVISION OF CHARITY CARE BY NONPROFIT HOSPITALS, Chen here - Just a note, this is actually a thesis but I found the background particularly insightful."

    "text": "Going Forward\nMuch of the empirical literature on hospitals explains why the non-profit form is so dominant, but I can’t quite say that the non-profit form is so dominant among ownership for TCs. For-profit centers are increasing, therefore future posts will consider the profit incentives of a for-profit firm, where they receive most of their funding and what the source of payment (or what they accept) is for the for-profit firm.\nIn particular, some questions I’ll be answering:\n\nWhat is the breakdown of services offered across ownership?\n\nDo for-profit TCs offer more revenue-generating services? What are those services?\n\nOutpatient/residential?\n\n\nDo for-profits have more decision power in who they admit?\nWhat sort of funding do they receive via revenue (REVCHK in NSSATS/NSUMHSS data) and externally?\n\nChecking for possible grants, etc.\n\n\nI’m not going to take these figures as absolute fact. There are many reasons a center has to submit data to SAMHSA for the survey, particularly if they receive state/federal funding of any kind. It may be that for-profits have always been fairly present but were not marked in the data across time. If that is the case, I can discuss ways we might think about instrumenting for the true count of for-profit TCs and discerning whether there is a true rise or not.\nPlease feel free to DM/email me for comments or questions. The code for this project is available on my Github."

    "text": "In the last post I discussed some of the motivation for wanting to look at treatment center (TC) ownership proporitons and compare them to hospitals. In the last 25 years we’ve seen a steep rise in for-profit TCs from around 25% to over 40%. This development is dissimilar to hospitals which are majority non-profit over the same time period.\nOne last thing I should’ve checked was mental health. As I try to understand a bit more the reason for the rise in for-profit TCs, I thought about how possible changes to Medicaid/Medicare and parity laws might impact things. The logic is flawed already because the main change in public insurance that would’ve impacted TC ownership would be parity, but since that passed in 2010 via the ACA and the rise began before that, I think there must be some other explanation. But just to double check, here is the chart of mental health agencies specifically.\n\nAs can be seen in this figure, the non-profit landscape dominates the mental health industry in-line with hospitals, though it seems that for-profit mental health clinics are a bit more popular than publicly owned clinics.\nThis is all to say: my next goal for this series is to explore (descriptively) some of the differences between for and non profit TCs. Today’s post will be about payment type accepted. One of the main reasons a center might orient itself as a non-profit is because of the tax incentive received by these organizations. This is because, from a revenue-maximizing standpoint, those who are un or under-insured should be under-treated since they have such low reimbursement rates; the government then steps in to ensure those who are un or under-insured still receive treatment. This is all to say: we may expect differences in the payment types accepted across ownership types. For-profit treatment centers have an incentive to accept fewer patients whose billing has a low reimbursement rate or a low revenue generation. This should also extend to facility offered services, though I’ll tackle those next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on Interpretation\n\n\n\nThese charts are descriptive, not causal. None of what I say here should be taken as evidence of causal relationships.\nI raise this because there’s been some discourse on X about the role of peer review. As summarized in the tweets below, Nate Silver argues that journals might benefit from having non-academic practitioners on peer review committees, suggesting journalists are better at detecting “BS.” He also contends that Substack posts and graphics could be a faster and better alternative to the traditional publishing pipeline.\n\n\nAcademic journals might be a lost cause but they'd probably be better if you had some non-academic practitioners serving as reviewers.

    "text": "What does this mean for TCs?\nOverall, acceptance patterns move in the same direction across ownership types. If I were to plot the change in acceptance rather than the raw proportion, the trajectories would look quite similar. That aligns with evidence from hospitals suggesting that ownership alone does not drive radically different decisions.\nWhere the differences emerge is in public insurance. Lower reimbursement rates, heavier administrative requirements, and patient mix considerations make Medicaid and Medicare less attractive to for-profits. While these have been discussed in public finance literature for quite some time, the fact that for-profits may not even accept private insurance might hint at the fact that dealing with any insurance at all is itself a significant enough burden/cost.\nThis flexibility helps explain the rise of for-profits over the past two decades. By choosing which patients to serve (and which to exclude), for-profits can structure their operations around revenue-maximizing groups. While the government incentivizes the treatment of those un/underinsured leading to increased access to non-profit and public facilities in the short run, the general equilibrium effect may align with the intent. In other words, expanding access for the uninsured can also create space for more for-profits to enter, potentially shifting market power away from non-profit and public providers and making a variety of treatment options less attainable.\nI plan on continuing to work on this, with tackling services next. It may be the case that payment type not only affects the people served but the services that a TC provides due to the close link between insurance coverage and service design."
